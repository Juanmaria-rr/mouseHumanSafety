## Safety Human Mouse

### Introduction

#### This repository describes ongoing work using Open Targets data to use mouse Knock outs models to inform human safety for Drug Discovery.


##### The most important use of mouse models for drug discovery could be summarize in the three next sections: 

**1. Disease Modeling:**
   - Mouse models replicate a wide range of human diseases.
   - They aid in understanding disease mechanisms and identifying potential drug targets.

**2. Safety and Toxicity Testing:**
   - Mice are crucial for assessing drug safety and potential toxicity.
   - This step is vital for predicting human safety and optimizing drug dosages.

**3. Efficacy Testing:**
   - Mouse models enable the evaluation of drug effectiveness prior to clinical trials.
   - They reduce the risk of costly late-stage failures, ensuring the advancement of promising drug candidates.
